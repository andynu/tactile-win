Provides keyboard-centric window tiling where users press a hotkey (Win+T), see a grid overlay with key labels (QWER/ASDF), and press two keys to tile the active window to the combined region.\n\n## Technical Approach\n- Pure Rust with windows-rs crate for Win32 APIs\n- Single binary, no runtime dependencies\n- Layered transparent overlay window for grid display\n- Global hotkey registration for activation\n- Multi-monitor support via MonitorFromWindow\n\n## Key Features\n- 4x2 grid mapped to QWER (top) and ASDF (bottom)\n- Two-key selection: first key = anchor, second key = extent\n- Configurable gap sizes between tiles\n- Works with multiple monitors\n- Escape to cancel\n\n## Reference\nBased on GNOME Tactile: https://gitlab.com/lundal/tactile","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-13T16:20:17.344258925-05:00","created_by":"andy","updated_at":"2026-01-13T16:25:48.162671212-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-13T16:25:48.162671212-05:00","close_reason":"Duplicate"}
